# About
This is a work in progress. It contains a partially complete jupyter notebook for learning how to implement lane line detection using OpenCV in Python for the UC Davis AI Society Club.

For now, this contains exercises for completing camera calibration, image un-distortion, applying the perspective transformation, and applying gradient thresholds to an image.

Clone this repo, fork it, or download it. It doesn't matter. All the TODO's are in the jupyter notebook. Good luck!
